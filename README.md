# Linkage-disequilibrium-calculator

A python program written as part of an undergraduate research project to calculate the [Linkage Disequilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium) from DNA sequence data. I used data from the [Galaxy ODoSE project](http://www.odose.nl/). 

The program will generate graphs based on the calculations but will need some path changes to function after downloading, unfortunately I was rushing to meet the deadline and had to make a few shortcuts with hard-coding paths...
