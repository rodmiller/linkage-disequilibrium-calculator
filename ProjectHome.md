# Linkage Disequilibrium Calculator #

A program written in Python which takes sequence data in FASTA format and generates graphs of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) against Genomic Distance for bacterial species.

Used in analysis of the presence of a **decline in LD with distance** which shows that recombination is occuring.

This can show the rate of bacterial recombination _in vivo_. It was used to generate the graphs used in _Patterns of Linkage Disequilibrium in Bacteria_, a final year project at The School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, UK.
